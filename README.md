# As Introduction
Due to lack of any experience with C development, I did a try to "play" with it.
The solution by its own does not represent any specific technical, logical or algorithmic optimisations. It does not pretend to be complete as well.
The purpose and use of the project is to learn and demonstrate my personal vision and aproach in development using technologies where I have hardly any experience.

# Requirements
* Implement a game like http://2048game.com
* User interface should be done as ASCII/console-based with ability to easily evolve it to anything else
* The code should be compilable on Linux using plain make / cmake

# Implementation Restrictions
* C++ / C++11
* Standard Library dependencies only
* GCC compiler
